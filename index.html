            <h1>Chuck Wood</h1>
            <p>
                How much wood would a wood chuck chuck if a would chuck could chuck wood? This question has been in my mind for quite some time now, and I think I've come to an answer.
                <br>The answer: If a wood chuck could chuck wood it would probably chuck about the amount the normal adult human of age 33 years, and 180cm tall would chuck in the same amount of time.
